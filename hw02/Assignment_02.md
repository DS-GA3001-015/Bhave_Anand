## 2. Layers and Clusters  
  
  
### a) Color by Type of Property  
  
  
For this question, to inform the reader about the property types of the severe fire incidents, following methodology was used,
  
1. The number of original distinct categories for properties total to 87.  
2. In order to maintain conciseness for the visualization, these categories were bucketed into 5 categories based on their similarity with other property types.  
3. Finally, the main categories were,  
  a. Residential property
  b. Restaurants and Hotels
  c. HealthCare Facilities
  d. Stores and Services
  e. Recreation, Study places and Other  
    
The following visualization shows an interactive display of the affected property types.

### b) Clusters    
  
In order to provide a high-level perspective to the user about the fire incidents, clusters are used and selecting any of the cluster the reader can zoom into the area of his interest to view fire incidents across that area.  
  

```r
f_2b <- f %>% addCircleMarkers(color = color_fccsel1,popup = new_content,clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()) %>% addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~fires$fccsel1, title = "Affected Property Types",position = "topleft")
f_2b

### Location of FireStations  
  
In order to understand how a particular incident is contained by the fire authorities, the knowledge and precise location of Fire Stations is essential.    
The following layered visualization provides a insight into the location of fire incidents coupled with the location of fire stations in a cluster format, categorized by property types.   
  

```r
firestations = read_csv('FDNY_Firehouse_Listing.csv')
addn_content_fire_incidents <- paste("Incident:",fires$INCIDENT_TYPE_DESC,"<br/>",
                 "Property Type:",fires$PROPERTY_USE_DESC,"<br/>",
                 "Property Category:",fires$fccsel1,"<br/>",
                 "Borough:",fires$BOROUGH_DESC,"<br/>",
                 "Units on Scene:",fires$UNITS_ONSCENE,"<br/>")

addn_content_fire_stations <- 
  paste("FireStation Address:",firestations$FacilityAddress,"<br/>",
        "Borough:",firestations$Borough,"<br/>")

f_3a <- leaflet() %>% setView(lng = -74.0156491, lat = 40.7022541, zoom = 10) %>% addTiles('http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',group = 'baselayer')

f_3a_addn <- f_3a %>% 
  
  addCircleMarkers(data = fires, color = color_fccsel1,popup =   addn_content_fire_incidents,radius=fires$UNITS_ONSCENE,clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),group = "Fire Incidents") %>% 
  
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = fires$fccsel1, title = "Affected Property Types",position = "topleft", group = "Fire Incidents") 
  
  f_3a_addn<- f_3a_addn %>% addCircleMarkers(data = firestations,color = 'Red',clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),group = "Fire Stations", popup = addn_content_fire_stations) %>%

 
### Distance from FireHouse and Response Time  

  
## A)
  
The following figure elaborates more on the concept of locating the nearest firestations to the incident of fire.  
The red dots signify the location of firestations across five boroughs. For each incident of fire, a line has been drawn to its nearest firestation. This enables us to visualize and get a overview of how the fire department would deploy its resources to prevent and contain severe fire incidents.

As seen from the following visualizations, the mean time to respond is highest for Staten Island and lowest for Brooklyn.  
The mean distance from nearest firestation is largest in case of Staten Island while smallest in case of Manhattan. Also residential places were quickest to reach in terms of average time taken to reach incident location.
